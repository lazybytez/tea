## Usage:
1. To start working with the CLI just add it globally:  
```bash
npm i -g teabrew
```
`Note: You can also install this with other package mangers such as pnpm or yarn.`

2. Then you can use the CLI with the command: `tea`

More on that here: [How does the CLI work?](https://github.com/lazybytez/tea/wiki/How-does-everything-work)
